# github-explorer-2

Simple repository explorer made using GitHub API.

This is the first project created during the Ignite course by Rocketseat.

The focus in this project was to learn the basics of a React app structure, without using a boilerplate like create-react-app.

I learned about Babel, Webpack, TypeScript settings (tsconfig) and a lot more.
